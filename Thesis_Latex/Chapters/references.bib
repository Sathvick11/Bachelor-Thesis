  abstract  = {DevOps is extended from certain agile practices with a mix of patterns intended to improve collaboration between development and operation teams. The main purpose of this paper is to conduct a study on how DevOps practice has impacted to software quality. The secondary objective is to find how to improve quality efficiently. A literature survey has carried out to explore about current DevOps practices in industry. According to the literature survey, the conceptual research model was developed and five hypotheses were derived. Research objectives were accomplished by testing hypotheses using Pearson correlation. A linear model is derived based on the linear regression analysis. An online questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data whereas interviews with experts on DevOps and Quality assurance have been used to identify how to improve the quality of software by practicing DevOps. Recommendations are given based on interview feedback, hypotheses testing with regression analysis. According to the quantitative study, researchers have identified that quality of the software gets improved when practice DevOps by following CAMS (Culture, Automation, Measurement, Sharing) framework. Automation is the most critical factor to improve the software quality. As per the results of multiple regression analysis, it has proved culture, automation, measurement and sharing are important factors to consider to improve quality of the software. In conclusion it can be recommended to use DevOps to achieve high quality software.},

  abstract  = {The proposed research article focuses on Continuous Integration, Testing, Delivery and Deployment in terms of DevOps environment. DevOps is a combination of development and operations. In a usual work environment, both development and operations of that company work entirely differently where mutual interaction is said to be minimum. Thus, to overcome that, DevOps was introduced, where both development and operations must work together in the same environment. In this article we will discuss what each of these terms means, how they work, why they are important in todayâ€™s software development life cycle (SDLC), what tools are used for each of them, etc. We will consider a few scenarios where the above-mentioned topics are better than the traditional or the most widely used SDLC methodologies.},

  abstract={Agile practices with Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CICD) pipeline approach has increased the efficiency of projects. In agile, new features are introduced to the system in each sprint delivery, and although it may be well developed, the delivery failures are possible due to performance issues. By considering delivery timeline, moving for system scaling is common solution in such situations. But, how much system should be scaled? System scale requires current system benchmark status and expected system status. Benchmarking the production is a critical task, as it interrupts the live system. The new version should go through a load test to measure expected system status. The traditional load test methods are unable to identify production performance behavior due to simulated traffic patterns are highly deviated from production. To overcome those issues, this approach has extended CICD pipeline to have three automation phases named benchmark, load test and scaling. It minimizes the system interruption by using test bench approach when system benchmarking and it uses the production traffic for load testing which gives more accurate results. Once benchmark and load test phases are completed, system scaling can be evaluated. Initially, the pipeline was developed using Jenkins CI server, Git repository and Nexus repository with Ansible automation. Then GoReplay is used for traffic duplication from production to test bench environment. Nagios monitoring is used to analyze the system behavior in each phase and the result of test bench has proven that scaling is capable to handle the same load while changing the application software, but it doesn't optimize response time of application at significant level and it helps to reduce the risk of application deployment by integrating this three phase approach as CICD automation extended feature. Thereby the research provides effective way to manage Agile based CICD projects.},

pages={1100-1125},
abstract={Automated testing is a basic principle of agile development. Its benefits include early defect detection, defect causelocalization and removal of fear to apply changes to the code. Therefore, maintaining high quality test code is essential. This study introduces a model that assesses test code quality by combining source code metrics that reflect three main aspects of test codequality: completeness, effectiveness and maintainability. The model is inspired by the Software Quality Model of the SoftwareImprovement Group which aggregates source code metrics into quality ratings based on benchmarking. To validate the model we assess the relation between test code quality, as measured by the model, and issue handling performance. An experiment isconducted in which the test code quality model is applied to $18$  open source systems. The test quality ratings are tested for correlation with issue handling indicators, which are obtained by mining issue repositories. In particular, we study the (1) defect resolution speed, (2) throughput and (3) productivity issue handling metrics. The results reveal a significant positive correlation between test code quality and two out of the three issue handling metrics (throughput and productivity), indicating that good test code quality positively influences issue handling performance.},

  abstract={Software testing is an integral part of the software development lifecycle, ensuring that software meets quality and functionality requirements. Traditionally, testing has been carried out at specific stages, such as during development or before release. However, this approach often leads to delayed defect detection, increased costs, and reduced overall software quality. To overcome these challenges, the concept of continuous testing has emerged as a critical practice in software testing. Continuous testing (CT) is an iterative and automated process that integrates testing activities throughout the software development cycle. It involves running tests early, frequently, and consistently, enabling immediate feedback on code changes and rapid identification of defects. Continental Automotive introduces a novel solution to address specific project requirements that cannot be fulfilled by Jenkins Due to project dependencies. Introducing the Contest Tool, an internally developed application designed for seamless Continuous Testing. This powerful tool enables downloading of project-specific source application files, seamlessly loading the software to the ECU, conducting comprehensive smoke tests, and generating detailed reports. Moreover, the Contest Tool possesses the unique capability of identifying variances in project-specific checkpoints, allowing for efficient Continuous Testing even when differences arise in the source application files. With its comprehensive features and adaptability, the Contest Tool revolutionizes the testing process, ensuring enhanced quality and reliability in project execution.},

  abstract={Automated tools are frequently used in social coding repositories to perform repetitive activities that are part of the distributed software development process. Recently, GitHub introduced GitHub Actions, a feature providing automated work-flows for repository maintainers. Although several Actions have been built and used by practitioners, relatively little has been done to evaluate them. Understanding and anticipating the effects of adopting such kind of technology is important for planning and management. Our research is the first to investigate how developers use Actions and how several activity indicators change after their adoption. Our results indicate that, although only a small subset of repositories adopted GitHub Actions to date, there is a positive perception of the technology. Our findings also indicate that the adoption of GitHub Actions increases the number of monthly rejected pull requests and decreases the monthly number of commits on merged pull requests. These results are especially relevant for practitioners to understand and prevent undesirable effects on their projects.},
