\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Overview}
This thesis explains about the creation and development of a framework for Optislang workflows. The workflow mostly contains modules created using Python and
MATLAB.


\section{Objective}
The objective of this thesis are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop a method to create a standalone version of MATLAB and Python based modules in Optislang for integration testing (only code based, without using 
    \acrshort{gui}).
    \item Implement workflows in batch mode.
    \item Create a framework in Python to create modules and workflows.
    \item Establish a strategy to for automated integration testing in Github for modules based on Python and MATLAB. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Outline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item   In Chapter 2, we are going to discuss about the \acrshort{moo} project, its role in the company and the modules created in Python and Optislang.
    \item   In Chapter 3, we understand the creation of a framework to create standalone modules and workflows in Python.
    \item   In Chapter 4, we will look into the automated integration testing in Github.
    \item   In Chapter 5, we will discuss the results and evaluate the impact of the solution.
    \item   Finally, Chapter 6 provides us the summary of the work, highlighting the achievements and feedback for development in potential areas.
\end{itemize}
