\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Overview}
This thesis explains about the creation and development of a framework for Optislang workflows.


\section{Objective}
The objective of this thesis are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Development of a method to create standalone modules in Optislang, based in MATLAB and Python.(only code based, without using 
    \acrshort{gui}).
    \item Implementation of modules and workflows without the help of \acrshort{gui}.
    \item Creation of a framework in Python to create and test modules and workflows in Optislang.
    \item Establishment of a strategy for automated integration testing in Github for modules based in Python and MATLAB. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Outline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item   In Chapter 2, we are going to discuss about the \acrshort{moo} project, its role in the company and the modules created in Python and Optislang.
    \item   In Chapter 3, we understand the creation of a framework to create standalone modules and workflows in Python.
    \item   In Chapter 4, we will look into the automated integration testing in Github.
    \item   In Chapter 5, we will discuss the results and evaluate the impact of the solution.
    \item   Finally, Chapter 6 provides us the summary of the work, highlighting the achievements and feedback for development in potential areas.
\end{itemize}
