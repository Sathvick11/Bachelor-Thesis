\begin{abstract}
System developers at Bosch create modules in MATLAB and Python to address specific use cases. These modules are integrated into Optislang, a software tool used 
for optimization analysis. For every new feature in the modules, developers must generate a new version and test it locally, a process that is both time-consuming 
and error-prone. This thesis proposes a solution to automate the testing of these modules. The modules are executed using a Python-based framework, which is 
integrated into a \acrfull{ci} pipeline on GitHub. This pipeline is triggered whenever a new commit is pushed to the repository, running the 
tests and providing feedback to the developers. By implementing this solution, developers receive immediate feedback and can focus more on developing new 
features.
